# Steganography
Steganography in C â€“ Hides secret data in images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. It encodes a magic string, file size, and data by modifying pixel LSBs with minimal visual impact. The decoding process extracts hidden data by reading LSBs and verifying the magic string, ensuring secure data concealment.
